## Preface

1. Institutions are looted and burned as quickly as they are built
1. A conception of whether the strivings of the human race overlong stretches of time have left us better or worse off?
1. Though theories of human nature rooted in biology are often associated with fatalism about violence
1. We started off nasty and that the artifices of civilization have moved us in a noble direction
1. Knowing that the very idea invites skepticism, incredulity ans sometimes anger
1. Especially when they are stoked by media that follow thr watchword  'if it bleeds, it leads'
1. Scenes of carnage are more likely to be beamed into our homes and burned into our memories than footage of people dying of old age
1. A large swath of our intellectual culture is loath to admit that there could be anything good about civilization, modernity, and Wester society
1. IN the teeth of these preconceptions, I will have to persuade you with numbers
1. but to my repeated astonishment, the global trends in almost all of them, viewed from the vantage point of the present, point downward. That calls for documenting the various trends between a single pair of covers,  and seeking commonalities in when, how, and why they have occurred
1. and that calls for an explanation
1. My approach is scientific in the broad sense of seeking explanations for why things happen
1. the way to explain the decline of violence is to identify the changes in our cultural and material milieu that have given our peaceable motives the upper hand
1. more likely to engage in trade
1. It's not easy to tell which of these happy traits got the virtuous circle started and which went along for the ride
1. Exogenous forces can originate in the practical realm ... intellectual realm as new ideas are conceived and disseminated and take on a life of their own
1. in different ways at different times and that thereby can be said to have caused the declines in violence
1. that it won't spoil the story if I preview its major conclusions
1. six trends to give some coherence to the many developments that make up our species retreat from violence
1. the first, which took place on the scale of millennia, was the transition from anarchy of the hunting
1. the second transition spanned more than half a millennium
1. to the consolidation of a patchwork of feudal territories into large kingdoms with centralized authority
1. the third transition unfolded on the scale of centuries and took off around the time of Age of Reason
1. the fourth major transition took place after the end of World War II
1. the fifth tread is also about armed combat but is more tenuous 
1. these spin-off from the concept of human rights
1. Nothing could be further from a contemporary scientific understanding of the psychology  of violence. Aggression is not a single motive, let alone a mounting urge. It is the output of several psychological systems that differ in their environmental triggers, their internal logic, their neurobiological basis, and their social distribution: predatory o Instrumental Violence, Dominance, Revenge, Sadism, and Ideology
1. Empathy prompts us to feel the pain of others to align their interests with our own.
1. Self-control allows us to anticipate the consequences of acting on our impulses and to inhibit them accordingly
1. the moral sense sanctifies a set of norms and taboos that govern the interactions among people in a culture, sometimes in ways to decrease violence
1. the faculty of reason allows us to extricate ourselves from our parochial vantage point, to reflect on the ways in which we live our lives
1. Homosapiens has literally evolved to become less violent in the biologist's technical sense of a change on our genome
1. Five historical forces  ... that favor our peaceable motives that have driven the multiple declines in violence
1. the Leviathan, a state and judiciary with a monopoly on the legitimate use of forces
1. Commerce is a positive-sum game in which everybody can win
1. Feminization is the process in which cultures have increasingly respected the interests and values of women
1. Cosmopolitanism such as literacy, mobility, and mass media can prompt people to take the perspective of people unlike themselves
1. Finally, an intensifying application of knowledge and rationality to human affairs, the Escalator of Reason
